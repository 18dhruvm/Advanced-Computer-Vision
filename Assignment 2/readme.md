Panorama Image Stitching
This project is a Python implementation for creating a panoramic image by stitching together multiple images using feature detection, matching, and homography transformations.

Prerequisites
To run the code, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Matplotlib
Glob
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Usage
Organize Images:

Place all the images to be stitched into a single folder (e.g., New Folder).
Ensure that the images are named and ordered such that consecutive images have overlapping regions.
Run the Script:

Update the image_paths variable to point to your folder containing the images.
Run the script in your Python environment.
Output:

The script will process the images to:
Detect keypoints and descriptors using SIFT.
Match features between consecutive images using the BFMatcher.
Estimate homographies using RANSAC.
Warp and blend the images to create a final panoramic image.
The panoramic image is displayed using Matplotlib.
Features
Feature Detection and Matching:

Detects keypoints and computes descriptors using the SIFT algorithm.
Matches features between consecutive images using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm.
Applies a ratio test to filter out poor matches.
Homography Estimation:

Computes homographies between consecutive image pairs using RANSAC.
Calculates the number of inliers and evaluates reprojection errors.
Image Warping and Blending:

Transforms images into a common coordinate frame.
Blends overlapping regions to produce a seamless panorama.
Customization
Adjusting Parameters:

You can modify the ratio test threshold (m.distance < 0.5 * n.distance) for feature matching.
Change the blending alpha value (alpha = 0.5) to adjust the blending strength.
Visualization:

Uncomment the visualization blocks to display intermediate results like:
Keypoints detected in each image.
Top 10 matches before and after applying RANSAC.
File Paths:

Update image_paths to point to your directory containing the images.
Known Limitations
Images with insufficient overlap may result in poor stitching or errors.
The script assumes all images are taken from a fixed camera position and primarily moves horizontally.
Example Output
The final panorama is displayed at the end of the script, showing a seamless stitched image from the input sequence.
